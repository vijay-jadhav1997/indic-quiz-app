Welcome to **Indic Quiz**, a Vanilla JavaScript-based quiz application built using Parcel. This app offers a variety of quizzes across different subjects, each with multiple levels. The application features a progressive unlocking system where users must achieve a minimum score to unlock higher levels. After completing a quiz, users are presented with a detailed scoreboard, including progress bars, a pie chart, and a scorecard.

## Features

  - **Multiple Subjects:** Choose from a wide range of subjects, including programming, sports, languages, general knowledge, aptitude, history, geography, art and culture, science, and more.

  - **Multi-Level Quizzes:** Each subject features multiple levels (Level 1, Level 2, etc.). Users can only access levels that have been unlocked by achieving the required score in the previous level.

  - **Unlock Levels:** Levels unlock when the user scores at least 33% on the current level. This encourages progressive learning and mastery of the subject.

  - **Scoreboard:** After finishing a quiz, users are presented with:
      - ***Progress Bars:*** Visual representation of the score for each section or question category.
      - ***Pie Chart:*** A breakdown of correct, incorrect, and skipped questions.
      - ***Scorecard:*** A detailed summary of the user's performance, including total score and percentage.
